# contact-form-php, NEED HELP!!
This contact form comes with the bootstrap template I downloaded a while ago. 

The original contact form came with text input such as name, telephone, email and messages. I need to add a couple of drop down menus in the same form so when the customer click "submit", both the selections and the text inputs can be sent to my email. 

The form.js file is for validation purpose and the contact_me.php file is for sending email. I made changes to these files so many times in order to make it work but till now, I still didn't have any luck (I've been struggling for more than a week on this already). 

I would appreciate it if anyone can help me solve this issue. 

Thank you.
